will make proper once minimum functionality is done -- but i'll at least share the origin

there's a youtuber called MagicGum who had a Minecraft server called Trapped SMP; the Discord community was shockingly enthusiastic pre-launch, and among other things, they made a family tree containing many prominent members

the server is long dead, but the Discord remains, and the family tree is maintained there; i made this with the intent to make that maintenence easier and to also let others make their own Discord family trees

if you find issues, do share :> -- i'll try to use my barely functional skills to fix em
